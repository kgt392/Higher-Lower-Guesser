# Higher-Lower-Guesser

The **Higher Lower Game** is a fun terminal-based number guessing game built using Python.  
In this game, the player is shown two entities (like celebrities or companies) and must guess which one has a **higher follower count** (or value). The game continues until the player guesses incorrectly.

This project is a great way to practice conditional logic, loops, functions, and working with dictionaries/lists in Python.

## 🎯 Features
- Compare two random entities and guess which has more value (e.g., Instagram followers).
- Score increases with each correct answer.
- Game ends when the user guesses incorrectly.
- Replays are supported.
